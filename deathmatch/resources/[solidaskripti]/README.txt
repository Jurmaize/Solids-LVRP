-- Script descriptions:
solid-drugs - Partially finished drug script.
solid-illegalweapons - Finished script where players can deliver rocks, illegal organizations can buy them and then craft weapons
The script also is partially English, since I had a different plan with it, but ended up leaving it in here. So yeah...
solid-jolt - Finished scooter rent script.
solid-mower - Finished lawn mower script.
solid-news - Unfinished update reading system. For both IC and OOC.
solid-staffcounter - Unfinished better looking staff counter. Doesn't work for Owl really, since it counts players within ACL groups.
solid-sweeper - Finished sweeping script.
solid-trucking - The most finished and polished script. Offers players the ability to use trucks to make money!
solid-xmas-event - Unfinished script where players can deliver vehicles to a christmas tree. Admins can later check who delivered the most to issue a prize.
